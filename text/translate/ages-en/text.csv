Ceremony might
fix it.
...Want to try?
  \opt()Yes \opt()No"
TX_5805,"Then that
\col(1)\call(0xff)\col(0)
will never be
restored..."
TX_5806,"You are willing
to try? Very
well. Follow me.
Heh, heh!"
TX_5807,"Welcome to
Patch's
Crazy Cart!
Will you partake
in my ceremony?
  \opt()Yes \opt()No"
TX_5808,"Very well! Do
you want to hear
the rules?
  \opt()No \opt()Yes"
TX_5809,"Then let me
explain!\stop
I'll place your
\col(1)\call(0xff)\col(0)
on that green
tile and recite
the words of my
Restoration
Ceremony. You
must knock all
the beasts that
appear into a
hole--any hole
will do. Sounds
easy, right?
...However!!!\stop
Restoration is
delicate work.
Your precious
\col(1)\call(0xff)\col(0)
sits on these
tracks...
The cart starts
moving when the
ceremony begins.
As long as you
stand on the
switch, the cart
won't hit your
\col(1)\call(0xff)\col(0),
but if you don't
and it gets hit,\stop
BANG!!!\stop
So? Will you
take part in
this fun--err,
delicate
ceremony?
  \opt()Yes \opt()No"
TX_580a,"Let the ceremony
begin!"
TX_580b,"Dex ifeb!!!
Dex iflla!!!"
TX_580c,"The ceremony
failed, but your
\col(1)\call(0xff)\col(0)
seems to have
survived. Try
again sometime."
TX_580d,"Hmm... Eh, heh!
My ceremony
succeeded! You
are talented.
You got through
this trap--err,
ceremony.
Here is your
\col(1)\call(0xff)\col(0),
as good as new!\stop
As usual, I am
perfect!"
TX_580e,Here you go.
TX_580f,"Bring me any-
thing else that
needs fixing,
and I'll prepare
my trap--err,
ceremony!"
TX_5810,"I haven't seen
you in awhile.\stop
If you've come
all the way up
the wall, you
must need
something fixed.
But my fun--
err, delicate
ceremony, is
more difficult
now. Do you
wish to try?
  \opt()Yes \opt()No"
TX_5811,"There is nothing
the restoration
guru cannot
repair!"
TX_5812,Tuni Nut
TX_5813,Broken Sword
TX_5814,Mermaid's Eye
TX_5900,"Are you also
searching for
that which \col(3)Ambi\col(0)
desires? You
should not go
further! There
are hordes of
terrible beasts!"
TX_5901,"Did you find
what \col(3)Ambi\col(0)
desires?"
TX_5902,"\col(3)Ambi's\col(0) \col(1)bombs\col(0)
have tremendous
power!"
TX_5903,"\pos(2)\col(3)Queen Ambi\col(0) is
busy! She's in
no mood for any
who come empty-
handed! Bring
her a rare item
in tribute if
you wish to
see her."
TX_5904,"Not bad, kid!
You found them!
Now come with me
to meet \col(3)Queen
Ambi\col(0)!"
TX_5905,"\pos(0)\col(3)Queen Ambi\col(0)! He
says he wishes
to pay tribute!
He brings the
\col(1)Mystery Seeds\col(0)
Your Majesty has
been seeking!"
TX_5906,"\pos(0)I shall guide
you."
TX_5907,"\pos(0)Yes, Your
Majesty!"
TX_5908,"\pos(2)Nice work, kid!
\col(3)Ambi\col(0) was most
pleased! You may
go now!"
TX_5909,"\pos(2)Don't loiter
around here too
much, kid!!!"
TX_590a,"You! You can't
come in without
permission!"
TX_590b,"Those are the
\col(1)Mystery Seeds\col(0)
\col(3)Queen Ambi\col(0) has
been demanding!
Nice work, kid!
I'll take you to
the palace!"
TX_590c,"\pos(0)Let's go, kid!"
TX_590d,"We must finish
the tower for
\col(3)Ambi\col(0) as quickly
as possible!"
TX_590e,"Loafers won't
get off easy!"
TX_590f,"What, kid?!?
Did you come to
help us build?"
TX_5910,"\col(3)Ambi\col(0) has gone
alone on a
soul-searching
journey. I hope
she returns
safely..."
TX_5911,"We must keep the
palace safe
while \col(3)Ambi\col(0)
is away!"
TX_5912,"\col(3)Ambi\col(0) said she
was going on a
soul-searching
journey, but
perhaps she went
to search for
her lover."
TX_5913,"You! Kids aren't
allowed in...
Sir \Link!
Excuse me!"
TX_5914,"It is our job to
guard the palace
with our lives!"
TX_5915,"You look just
like the statue
outside... Say!
Are you
\Link?!?
I never thought
I'd actually get
get to you!"
